# Simple blog made with very basic microservice style

This is the first basic project from Stephen Grider's [Microservices with Node JS and React]("https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/")

The client code is using a development configuration that I use instead of Create React App b/c it installs and get's up and running faster.

Postman is replaced with REST client (a VSC extention).
